ASSIGNMENT2
Anita Bentley
I decided to take this class to leanr more about websites and how the internet works! I also wanted to see what it would take to make my own website!It seems like a lot of work and is very time consuming.
Three things I have learned so far is that these class assignments take a while to complete, how the internet works and how I am able to send data through the internet. I hope to learn more about coding!
