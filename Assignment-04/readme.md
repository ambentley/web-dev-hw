I visited Hi5. It looked completeley different. It had way more graphics and content than the new page has. The new page only has a log in area where as the old hi5 had numerous links to other things and a a lot more graphics.
The four document elements are still hard for me to understand. This is the second time I have had to redo this assignment so remembering to save if a big thing!
